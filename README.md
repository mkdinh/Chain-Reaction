# Welcome to FISSION

Please use the information below to optimize your use of our application and dive into your component workspace.

# What it does:

FISSION is designed to help you visualize the complex structure of your React application components.  
Components that you add to your account, are stored as simple HTML markup, based in part of the structure of Material-UI.  
More information on Material-UI can be found in its [documentation](http://www.material-ui.com/#/). After logging in, you can quickly move to your Canvas workspace to begin working. 

In your Canvas space, you can select and preview  your components using the preview editor and display visualization spaces.  
Here, after clicking on the component of your choice, you can adjust its style and other useful tasks.   
Once you have finished making your selections, you can save your file and then download the full file for future use.
